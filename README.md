Project1: Image Data Naive Bayes Classifier
Created an Image Data Classifier Using a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier. Used a publicly available dataset. Link to the dataset is given here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Image+Segmentation.
Simple Classifier Built and Performance assessed using accuracy score, confusion matrix and ROC Curves.

Project2: Decision Tree Classifier for Pima Indians Dataset
Decision Tree Classifier created on Pima Indians Dataset and hyperparameter tuning done using GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters. Tree structure displayed to gain insight on key features. Performance assessed using accuracy score and confusion matrix on the test dataset.

Project3: SVM Classifier for Pima Indians Dataset
SVM Classifier created on Pima Indians Dataset and hyperparameter tuning done using GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.Performance assessed using accuracy score and confusion matrix on the test dataset.

Project4: Decision Tree Regression on the Diabetes Dataset
Decision Tree Regression done on diabetes dataset and r2 scores recored to test performance. 

Project5: Model Comparison on Pima Indians Dataset
Different Classifiers run on the same dataset and using the same seed to assess relative performance of classifiers. The classifiers used were: Decision Tree Classifier, SVM Linear Kernel Classifier, SVM Non-Linear Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboost Classifier and xgBoost Classifier.
